# Take-home Assignment #

### Goal
Create an Employee Table like seen in the image below. Use any framework (Angular, React, Vue, ect...) or CSS library you would like to accomplish this

### Setup ###
* Fork the repository onto your own personal Github account
* Setup new project with framework of your choice or create static site
  * Angular example setup
      * Install Node.js v18
      * $ cd my-assignment-name
      * $ npm install -g @angular/cli
      * $ ng new employee-table
      * $ cd employee-table
      * $ ng serve --open

### The table should have ###
* List all employees in mock-employee.json
  * First name, last name, and salary in currency (ie. $42,000)
* Ability to edit the employee information
* Ability to delete the employee
* Ability to add or create a new employee with a first name, last name, and salary

### Guidelines ###
* Structure your application and components in a modular/reusable way
* Commit code with useful and informative comments
* Use mock data (mock-employees.json)
* Do not implement API code
  * You can mimic a API call by creating a service but return only mock data
* Adding, deleting, or editing employees does not write back to the mock-employees.json file
* Styling: CSS or SCSS can be used, whichever you prefer (can use popular frameworks like Bootstrap as well)
